# Take U Forward: My DSA Journey (aka Striver) 🚀

Welcome to my repository where I document my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the **Striver's SDE Sheet** from [Take U Forward](https://takeuforward.org/). This sheet is a curated list of essential coding problems for interviews and DSA mastery. 🧠💻

## Overview 📚

This repository contains solutions and explanations for the problems listed in the Striver SDE Sheet. The problems cover a range of topics, including:

- Arrays and Strings 🥨
- Linked Lists 🔗
- Dynamic Programming 💡
- Binary Trees 🌳
- Graphs 📊
- Recursion and Backtracking 🔄
- And much more! 🌟

Each solution is written with readability, efficiency, and best practices in mind. Along with the code, I include brief notes or explanations wherever necessary. ✍️

## Repository Structure 📁

The problems are organized by topic for easy navigation:

```
📂 Patterns
   └── Patterns.java
📂 BasicsMathsForDSA
   └── CountDigits.java
...
```

## Why This Repository? 🤔

1. **Structured Learning**: Following Striver's Sheet ensures I cover all essential problems step-by-step.
2. **Interview Prep**: It helps prepare for coding interviews by tackling frequently asked DSA problems.
3. **Growth Tracking**: By solving and documenting each problem, I track my progress over time. 📈

## How to Use 🛠️
